  Hey There, Fellow Developer,
  This portfolio was made using React in a weekend - then the output was copied from the browser.

              <p>At Henry Ford College, I lead the overhaul of the entire website: design, navigation and content. The
                project involved many stakeholders that spanned all areas of the college. I created and strengthened
                direct relationships with all of these stakeholders by listening carefully to their goals and concerns,
                providing training and support, and following-up with regular communication.</p>
              <p>Stakeholder participation was essential in making the launch and adoption successful. Shown in the
                screenshot, you can see that the site changes immediately lead to more traffic on the new college
                application page.</p>

              <p>Early in my studies and career, I began advocating for usability and accessibility. In multiple job
                roles, I brought up these concerns and educated stakeholders until it became an adopted practice.</p>
              <p>At Henry Ford College, my dedication to these standards was a huge asset when Section 508 compliance
                became a top priority task across the college. From the onset, I was the subject matter expert while
                they searched for a permanent candidate to fill the Accessiblity Coordinator role. During this time, I
                drafted policy for cabinet leadership approval, and improved the website accessiblity score to 94%.</p>

                extension of my onboarding process, and even as a new hire, I became a relied upon reference in multiple
                teams.</p>

              <p>Freelance design work has been a hobby of mine from a young age. I have frequently created or

                the Adobe Creative Suite has allowed me to communicate seamlessly with UI/UX and designer team members,
                as well as fill that need when such a role was vacant.</p>
