    <h2>What is Always Un.inc?</h2>
    <h3>My child self was right about plenty</h3>
    <p>'Always Un.Inc' was a brand child me created as a holistic expression of my outward facing creative projects. It is a play on the phrases 'always unique' and 'always un-incorporated' because even child me thought capitalism stunk before they knew quite what it all meant. More than a cute name, creating something that is always unique and anti-capitalist is the founding principle of my work and a guiding virtue in my life.</p>
    <p>In the world of fast-paced consumerism, I have no idea where Always Un.Inc will end up along the way. The goal is to stay true to the intent & bring positive change to those around me through spreading lessons from my experiences, direct manifestations, and magical connections. I hope that you find something here that helps you manifest your goals!</p>
    <p>My lofty goal is to build this further as a magickal connection facilitator, as a support system. Someday, I hope to expand my team & employ like minded folks to do what I do in their own neighborhoods.</p>
    <h3>The Witch Behind the Curtain</h3>
    <div class="photo-aside">

        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/always.uninc/" class="button">Instagram</a>
        <p>You can find more of my creative and mystical pursuits on my daily Instagram & in the Highlights! But I'm shifting away from social media and focusing on these projects.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Besides website coding, I'm really passionate about equity, subverting capitalism, and the process of communal healing and growth. This may seem odd, but I practice magic in all aspects of my life, even online (remember the 90's techno pagans? oh yeah ~). I strongly believe that intentionality and energy are they key components to any magic or spiritual/religious action, so regardless of a person's faith, anyone can incorporate 'magic' into their online practices as well, I hope you do!</p>

    <h2>My Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Here is what I do not do or tolerate in my business interactions!</p>         
    <ul>
        <li>Evil SEO or anything shady</li>
        <li>Expensive, misguided, or harmful brand and product advertising</li>
        <li>Misgendering, disrespect, or bullying behavior. Don't test me and don't underestimate me. Zero tolerance policy for harmful behavior and red flags.</li>
        <li>Solicitation for contract work. Let me be very clear I do NOT work with contract house / recruiters and I hope that type of business of lying and labor exploitation dies a quick death. I welcome real connections and people that want to work with me -- but I want to talk to the owners and developers (not salespeople)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Want to work with me?</h2>
    <p>Here is how I choose partners: I aim to uplift and grow with as many of you as I can, but I must manage my energy.</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>I am anticapitalist, I believe in value as utility. I want to bring your unique value to the world. I do not work with "influencers" or anyone promoting 3rd party services or products.</li>
        <li>I prioritize individuals who have been impacted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy"><span>Kyriarchy</span></a>  and will work with you to make my services more accessible. </li>
        <li>I do not promote competition or appropriation. I believe we all have unique gifts to offer the world & that competition and scarcity is a capitalist falsehood. If I become aware of any stealing of ideas / imagery etc. I will not support that endeavor. I can help you find your own unique path if you are inspired by someone else.</li>
        <li>I work individually on your businessesâ€™ unique offerings. Every partnership is forged with my prior experience & future research dedicated to your gifts, resulting in a unique manifestation of your business that will stand out in the digital sea. I am inclined to choose open source, free or low-cost services etc. because I believe that there is no value, only evil, in monetization for profit.</li>
    </ul>
