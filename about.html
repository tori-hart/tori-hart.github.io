    <h2>Always Un.Inc Intentions</h2>
    <h3>More than a personal assistant!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I will be your business's #1 fan, your cheerleader, your coordinator, organizer, communicator, graphic designer, website manager. I'm here for you & rooting for your business's success.</li>
            <li>Never worry about taking a break from social media again!</li>
            <li>Together we can brainstorm new ways to engage clients.</li>
            <li>Over time we will create a distinct set of graphics and a recognizable brand style that's uniquely yours.</li>
            <li>Together we can execute spark of the moment ideas and update your website and social media quickly.</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Here is what I do not do!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I do not impersonate you: (although I will post with your account). It is healthy to have work life boundaries! It can spark feelings of guilt or undeservingness... but don't let captialism get you like that! Tell your clients that you are taking some of your own medicine, practicing self-care by getting an assistant! You will be getting assistance so that you'll have more capacity to actually do your craft.</li>
        <li>I do not practice your craft, nor moderate it:  while most comments and messages will be responded to & posts engaged with, but messages focused on your craft or asking for assistance are still yours to answer. I am a business facilitator to help you focus on what you do best</li>
        <li>I do not push products: I have a wide selection of trusted tools I use, and I make suggestions of free use tools wherever possible. If your needs require a 3rd party paid service I provide research and advice but the choice is yours. I remain flexible and will work with any tool/s that you prefer.</li>
        <li>I do not have a template: Everything I create is custom tailored to you & your vision. Over time this will settle into a recognizable set of brand assets and "templates" just for you.</li>

    </ul>
        <h3>Here is how I choose partners</h3>
    <p>I aim to uplift and grow with as many of you as I can, but I must manage my energy.</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>I am anticapitalist, I believe in value as utility. I want to bring your unique value to the world. I do not work with "influencers" or anyone promoting 3rd party services or products.</li>
        <li>I prioritize individuals who have been impacted by euro-centric colonialism  and will work with you to make my services more accessible. </li>
        <li>I do not promote competition or appropriation. I believe we all have unique gifts to offer the world & that competition and scarcity is a capitalist falsehood. If I become aware of any stealing of ideas / imagery etc. I will not support that endeavor. I can help you find your own unique path if you are inspired by someone else.</li>
        <li>I work individually on your businessesâ€™ unique offerings. Every partnership is forged with my prior experience & future research dedicated to your gifts, resulting in a unique manifestation of your business that will stand out in the digital sea.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>What is Always Un.inc?</h2>
    <h3>My child self was right about plenty</h3>
    <p>'Always Un.Inc' was a brand child me created as a holistic expression of my outward facing creative projects. It is a play on the phrases 'always unique' and 'always un-incorporated' because even child me thought capitalism stunk before they knew quite what it all meant. More than a cute name, creating something that is always unique and anti-capitalist is the founding principle of my work and a guiding virtue in my life.</p>
    <p>In the world of fast-paced consumerism, I have no idea where Always Un.Inc will end up along the way. The goal is to stay true to the intent & bring positive change to those around me through spreading lessons from my experiences, direct manifestations, and magical connections. I hope that you find something here that helps you manifest your goals!</p>
    <p>My lofty goal is to build this further as a magickal connection facilitator, as a support system. Someday, I would like this to grow into my main focus. I also hope to expand my team & employ like minded folks to serve more businesses.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Hi, I'm Tori <a href="">(they/them pronouns)</a>! I am a whole person who describes themselves in lots of ways. Professionally, I am a Front End Developer, I work with JavaScript, JS libraries, HTML5, CSS3 and other web technologies as they are relevant to my work! My background is heavily influenced by fundamentals and Web Accessibility which means I code in a way that adheres to WCAG standards so that people using assistive devices, and people who have visual or physical impairments can still use and understand what I make. You would be suprised but even with disability laws, private entities are not legally required to adhere to these standards. </p>
    <p>Besides website coding, I'm really passionate about equity, subverting capitalism, and the process of communal healing and growth. This may seem odd, but I practice magic in all aspects of my life, even online (remember the 90's techno pagans? oh yeah ~). I strongly believe that intentionality and energy are they key components to any magic or spiritual/religious action, so regardless of a person's faith, anyone can incorporate 'magic' into their online practices as well, I hope you do!</p>
